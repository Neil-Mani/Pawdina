          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>Pawdina's purpose goes beyond profits. We believe in giving back to the animals who need it most. That's why we pledge to donate 60% of our proceeds to support animal shelters in their noble efforts to rescue and care for homeless pets. The rest will go towards supplies needed to fund out efforts. With every purchase, you're not just pampering your furry companion; you're also lending a helping paw to those in need. Join us in our journey to create a world where every pet finds a loving home. Together, we can make tails wag and dreams come true, one tag at a time.</p>
